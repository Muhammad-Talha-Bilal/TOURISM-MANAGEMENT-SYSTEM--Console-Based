# TOURISM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
## Introduction:
  This project is, in essence, a tourism management system. It offers ways for users to view and book tours of their choice through several features available within the system.
Firstly, it offers a unique login mode with credentials: Username and Password. All users share the same interface and have access to certain features. The users may create accounts, login into their accounts, or view the menu available.
Secondly, the program creates and manages a file comprising of the user’s credentials. The file contains all the necessary information about each user.
Lastly, the program also provides a simple booking system that allows the users to book, check total, or cancel any booking associated with the user. In addition, the user can also change their password after logging in. 
However, there are certain limitations:
    • The user can make bookings for one place at a time.
    • The user cannot customize his tour plans.
    • The user's personal information is not stored.
